# Lumina MR
_Created and developed for [Meta Quest Presence Platform Hackathon 2024](https://metaquesthackathon.devpost.com/)_

## Inspiration
In the face of the ever-accelerating pace of the world, Lumina MR is a casual gaming experience that showcases the benefits of slowing down.

Heavily inspired by _Wrapped_ – a beautifully animated short film from 2014 – we set out to explore themes of presence, nature, and the passage of time while creating a visually stunning immersive environment.

Other inspirations include _Wisp's_ visual language development, NPC interactions, and plants’ growth cycle; _ABZÛ's_ and _Planet Alpha's_ art and environment development; and _Pillows's_ relaxing ambiance and use of the ceiling to create otherworldly environments.

## What it does
In Lumina, your presence fosters an immersive virtual garden on your ceiling, composed of 3 main elements: **Seeds**, **Islands**, and **Plants**.

**Seeds** are spawned randomly on the walls of your room every time you enter the garden.
You can use _pinch_ gestures (up close or from a distance) to grab them. Joining two seeds together causes them to merge and change properties. _Throwing/flinging_ the seeds toward the ceiling causes them to pop and give origin to islands and plants.

**Islands** are the base for plants to grow on.

**Plants** are affected by the passing of time. They grow naturally in your presence, but faster once you stop to admire them; they will also wither away in your absence.
A fully grown plant can be harvested, giving way to new seeds. Turn both your palms towards the fully grown plant to give origin to a new set of seeds.

The game has two distinct modes: **Building** and **Gazing**. These are represented by changes in the overall ambiance and sound effects, and affect the growth of the plants differently.
