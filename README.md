# meta-presence-hackathon-2024
Our hackathon project for the Meta Presence 2024 Hackathon

## Concept

### Seeds
- Seeds appear randomly in cracks in the walls, floor, and furniture in your room.
- **Touching** the seeds latched onto surfaces causes them to get released.
- Once released, they simply float around.
- **Grabbing** two floating seeds and joining them together causes them to be combined into a new seed. (Possible combinations are merging, containing, TBD)
- Popping the seeds by **pinching**, **slapping**, or **throwing** them against surfaces gives origin to a plant in your ceiling.
- Different combinations of seeds give origin to different plants.

### Plants
- Plants appear on the ceiling as a consequence of seeds getting popped.
- Plants grow naturally through time, but faster once you stop to admire them.
- A fully grown plant gives origin to a set of new seeds.

### The Helper
- The helper wanders around in the room until you get its attention or follows you until you get its attention.
- Get the helper's attention by **tapping** (when it's close) or **waving** (when itâ€™s far) at it.
- The helper eats the seeds and goes to the ceiling, where it gets absorbed and plants the plant.
